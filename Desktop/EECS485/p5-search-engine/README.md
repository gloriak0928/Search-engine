Project 5 Search Engine
===========================


Build a scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing.

The learning goals of this project include information retrieval concepts like text analysis (tf-idf) and link analysis (PageRank), and parallel data processing with MapReduce. Youâ€™ll also gain experience using a Service-Oriented Architecture to scale dynamic pages and web search.

Create a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs. Then, build an Index server, a REST API app that returns search results in JSON format. Finally, build a Search server, a user interface that returns search results just like Google or Bing.

## Quick start
```console
$ python3 -m venv env/
$ source env/bin/activate
```
